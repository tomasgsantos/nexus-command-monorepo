## Sprint 1 — Auth Scaffold

**Branch:** `feature/auth-scaffold`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Tester signed off. Pending user PR review into `dev`.

### What was built

| Package | Contents | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/ui` (`@nexus/ui`) | PostCSS design token file — full Obsidian Lens palette, typography, spacing, glass vars | ✅ |
| `apps/api` (`@nexus/api`) | `UserRole`, `Profile`, `AuthUser` types · `Database` schema type · `signIn`, `signInDemo`, `signOut`, `getSession` · typed Supabase client | ✅ |
| `supabase/migrations/` | `20260325_initial_schema.sql` — 7 tables, RLS enabled · `20260325_rls_policies.sql` — access policies · `20260325_demo_seed.sql` — demo user + sample data | ✅ |
| `apps/web/src/features/auth/` | `LoginPage.tsx` · `LoginCard.tsx` · `use-login-form.ts` · `use-demo-login.ts` · `auth.css` | ✅ |

### Test results
- 14 / 14 unit tests passing (`LoginPage.test.ts`)

### Post-scaffold fixes applied
- `supabase-client.ts` — removed `process.env` (browser crash), added `import.meta.env` with placeholder fallbacks
- `variables.css` — cleared conflicting `--color-primary` override
- `base.css` — added Space Grotesk font import, `box-sizing` reset
- `App.tsx` — all inline styles moved to `App.css`
- `components/Login/` — deleted (dead code)

### Known non-blocking issues (backlog)
- `fetchAuthUser` doesn't distinguish DB error from missing profile row — minor UX issue
- Demo seed events have no `ON CONFLICT` guard — duplicates on re-run

## Epic 1 — Pulse Dashboard

**Branch:** `feature/pulse-dashboard`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Tester signed off. Pending user PR review into `dev`.

### What was built

| `supabase/migrations/` | `20260327_pulse_indexes.sql` — indexes on `owner_id`, `health_status` | ✅ |
| `apps/web/src/features/pulse/` | `PulseDashboard.tsx` · `pulse.css` · `ProjectNode.tsx` · `PulseIndicator.tsx` · `ProjectPanel.tsx` · `KpiCard.tsx` · `use-realtime-feed.ts` · `use-pulse-map.ts` | ✅ |

### Contracts exported from `@nexus/api`
